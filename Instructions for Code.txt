Instructions to Run the Code:

In all, 4 files have been uploaded namely, “Project.py”, “Brands.txt”, “Countries.txt” and “Movies.txt”.
The three text files consist of list of the words that are used in the code.
The text files need to be kept in the same folder as the “.py” file.
Also, while running the code, there are certain places where the delay has been used to make the code more interactive.
Thus, do wait for the program to respond.
Another instruction would be to choose the category correctly as given by the program. If not, the program is coded to take care of this situation as well.
The program has been coded keeping in mind that the user can be anyone, thus keeping it simple and crisp.
Comments have been added to the program to make it understandable.
